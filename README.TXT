PROJECT TITLE:
Recipe Book Application

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
The purpose of this project is to create a simple digital recipe book.
The program stores different types of recipes (such as Soup, Fried, and
Baked), along with their ingredients, steps, tags, and ratings. Users can
search for recipes, view details, scale servings, rate dishes, and add
their own recipes. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming,
basic data structures, and simple menu-based interaction.

VERSION or DATE:December 2, 2025
